Try to find places where biologists hang out.

Email graduate admissions and just ask them.

Look into more background on protein structure.


-------------------

Consider taking a few classes at RIT.

Search around for schools with bioinformatics/computational biology programs.
Read their papers and find things that seem interesting. Look over their code
too.

Look through recent journals and try to pick a couple of recent papers that seem
approachable.

-------------------------------------------


Try branching out a little bit -- look at immunology, virology, microbiology.

Start learning cell biology next.


-------------------------------------

Find the top 5 people/grad schools whose work sound interesting.

Find faculty members look at lab websites, look at open positions and projects.

----------------------------

Get transcripts, see if any of my previous credits would transfer into a BS/MS.
Might be able to cut some years off a BS.

* MIT OpenCourseware
* Harvard extension school
* Start looking into cell and molecular biology
