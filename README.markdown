.plan
=====

I'm going to try keeping a `.plan`.  Let's see how this goes.

[Bones]: http://bitbucket.org/sjl/bones
[AMOP]: 
[Masters of Doom]: 
[Mazes]:

## 2016-06-01

* Created this thing.
* Added a fish alias to make it easier to edit.
* Also added a Vim mapping...

## 2016-06-02

* Added Prolog list support to [Bones][].  Need to think about the UI more, but
  it speeds things up considerably (I don't *fully* understand *why* yet...).
* Started playing guitar again after a month of so of not at all.  Truss rod is
  all out of whack thanks to the changing weather.
* Read some more [AMOP][].  My brain hurts.
* Read more [Masters of Doom][].
* Noticed the `dynamic-extent` declaration of a `flet`ed function in
  Alexandria's `extremum`... should look into this for the bigass `labels` in
  [Bones][].
* Did a bit more from the [Mazes][] book.
