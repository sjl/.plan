Back from break.  Started a new rotation (classes don't start for another
couple of days).  Feels good to be back.

## 2024-01-09

Another day of rotation before classes start.  Getting my laptop set up to do
actual work again.

Looked around a little bit in Canvas.  One of my classes doesn't seem to have
posted anything yet, but I'm definitely registered so I think I should be good.

Did a couple of tasks to get ready for classes tomorrow (though they don't
*really* start til Thursday).

Need to remember to bring things into the lab tomorrow:

* Something to put my laptop on to raise it.
* Headphones.
