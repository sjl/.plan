Back from break.  Started a new rotation (classes don't start for another
couple of days).  Feels good to be back.

## 2024-01-09

Another day of rotation before classes start.  Getting my laptop set up to do
actual work again.

Looked around a little bit in Canvas.  One of my classes doesn't seem to have
posted anything yet, but I'm definitely registered so I think I should be good.

Did a couple of tasks to get ready for classes tomorrow (though they don't
*really* start til Thursday).

Need to remember to bring things into the lab tomorrow:

* Something to put my laptop on to raise it.
* Headphones.

Cleaned up my schedule and sketched out my TODO list, found all the rooms for my
classes.  Got one new building to find/learn: USB, the "Undergraduate Science
Building".  I think I've seen it before, never been inside though.

First day of journal club.  Main things I'll need to do are:

* Ask two questions during the semester.
* Two review sessions for particular papers.
* Read over the rest of the papers.

First two actual classes.

BS521.  Fairly straightforward.  8:30 AM sucks.  Tried to change lab sections to
something that works better with my schedule, but the class registration system
is awful and won't let me swap things out for some reason, despite there being
open seats.

BI529.  Need to watch videos (and do the embedded quizzes) before classes.
Really awful high-pitched whine from something in the ceiling in the spot I sat
in the room â€” need to move around and find a spot that isn't going to destroy my
ears. Got both Great Lakes and my VM set up with Jupyter (I think) and
accessibly by SSH port forwarding (e.g. `ssh -NAL 8888:localhost:8888
slosh@gl1234 -J gl`) so we'll see how this goes during the next class I guess.

Poked around at running `make docs` in a Lisp project with my new laptop and
something in `d`'s Python dependency shitpile broke since I last built it, so
I had to screw around with the guts of `d` to get it rendering again.  I really
need to rewrite `d` in a sane language.

Attempted to set up printing in the lab, but of course it doesn't work on Linux.

Downloaded the first 3 papers for journal club.  Need to print them and start
reading soon, at least for next week's.

After going back and forth with someone about the BS522 lab section stuff, they
realized they needed to grant me permission for that section.  Once they did
that I was able to swap it, so that's all set now.
