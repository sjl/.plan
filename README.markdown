.plan
=====

I'm going to try keeping a `.plan`.  Let's see how this goes.

[Bones]: http://bitbucket.org/sjl/bones

* Created this thing.
* Added a fish alias to make it easier to edit.
* Also added a Vim mapping...

## 2016-06-02

* Added Prolog list support to [Bones][].  Need to think about the UI more, but
  it speeds things up considerably (I don't fully understand *why* yet...).
