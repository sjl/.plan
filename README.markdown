Rebooting this `.plan` after a long absence.  Again.

More work on switching to Linux.

Switched to [pass](http://passwordstore.org) from 1Password so I can use it
everywhere.  1Password has been pushing the cloud version pretty hard, so it's
probably only a matter of time before they deprecate the real app.  This was
painful.  I had to hack apart the `1password2pass.rb` file to handle my naming
conventions, and of course the version of that script in the `pass` repo was out
of date.

Got `weechat` up and running.  I can communicate again.

Got `offlineimap` running, but didn't finish the syncing yet (I have a lot of
mail).

Tore Roswell out of my `lispindent` and `clhs` scripts so it just builds with
vanilla SBCL now.  So much easier and less brittle.

Backlight support (specifically `xbacklight`) required editing `xorg.conf` as
described in the Arch wiki.  The backlight keys on the keyboard still don't
work, but at least I can dim the screen.

`xcape` remains busted in stumpwm for now.  Will debug later.

Getting VPN set up.  Mostly used the network manager GUI to handle the settings.
To disable saving of the password I had to click the silly little icon in the
right of each password field.

Got my `xrandr` bullshit mostly tamed, thanks to some Lisp code from katco.
It's really nice to be able to script my window manager to add hotkeys with
Common Lisp.

More math review.  I'm rusty.

More homework from the Prolog class.  This time it was the classic Family Tree
style exercise.  Wasn't too tough, even though my Prolog is *really* rusty.

Still on OS X for personal stuff until the rest of the parts for my
Linux/Windows machine arrive.

Math review.

Finished the Trains exercise for the Prolog class.  It was harder than
I expected â€” my Prolog skills definitely need work.  But I guess that's what the
class is for, right?

The quest to make my new Linux machine usable continues.  Finally managed to
build Weechat from source after screwing around in dependency hell for a while
(apparently there's no `libgnutls30-dev` for Ubuntu 18.04?).  Also managed to
get the sound coming out the right ports after some dark incantation with
`pactl`.  Not using Gnome as a WM apparently means I'm going to be perpetually
confused about how to configure anything on this damn machine, I guess.

Catching up in the Prolog class.  Thankfully tomorrow is a holiday so I can
hopefully make some good progress there too.
